Staff Management System <br/>
An employee management system uses a series of methods to gather and manage information about the employees of a business. In this idea, we target to develop an employees management system to collect and manage the employee information of a small business. <br/>
The system will include the following features: 
1) create a new employee with employee ID, name, age, role, and salary; 
2) search for and delete an employee via their ID, name, age or role;
3) fire an employee; 
4) edit the details of an existing employee;
5) search for all employees with a salary higher than or lower than a user input; 
6) allow adding user-defined attributes, the value of a new attribute of the existing employee should be empty or undefined;
7) allow sorting the database according to specific attributes;
8) menu will be displaced to help the users realize the functions.
